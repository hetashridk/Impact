PyPy constains JITC

14 datatypes
categories into 6 category:- numeric, boolean, sequence, set, mapping, none
numeric:- int, float, complex - immutable
boleans:- bool
sequence:- str (immutable), list, bytes, bytearray, tuple, range 
set:- set, frozen set
mapping:- dict
none:- None

datatypes are dynamic and unbounded
size of data type is dynamically managed

python starts with intial size for a variable and then we cam increase it

intial size is 24 bytes (int)


to check the size we need to import the sys
import sys
sys.getsizeof(0) 

to convert number of binary we will write in prefix as 0b or 0B
h = 0b101 => o/p:- 5
h = 101 => o/p:- 101

to convert number of octal we will write in prefix as 0o or 0O

to convert number of hexdecimal we will write in prefix as 0x or 0X

binary to octal, decimal, hexdecimal
bin()
bin(25) => otp:- 0b11001
bin(0o25) => otp:- 0b10101

same as oct(), 



options=> inventory => 1
inventory is stock => item no, name, quantity

searchbyId => 101 eg =>print rice => 500kg, 50 inr  else print not available
searchbyname => 101 eg => id => 500kg, 50 inr else print not available

by from vendor =>check item id, name, quantity, net price

sale the item for customer=> ask quantity
